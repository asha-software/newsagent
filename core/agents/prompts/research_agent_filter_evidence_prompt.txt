You are an expert researcher. You will read a 'claim' then a chunk of text.

### INFO
* The claim may be true or false
* The text chunk may contain information that verifies the claim, contradicts it, or the text chunk may be irrelevant
* The text chunk may be long, such as a whole Wikipedia page or web page, and the relevant parts might only be certain paragraphs

### To Do
1. Determine if the text chunk is relevant to the claim
2. If the text chunk is relevant, extract and write out ONLY the relevant parts of the text
3. If the text chunk has NO relevant parts, write out an empty string

### OUTPUT FORMAT
{
    "isRelevant": bool,
    "content": string
}
