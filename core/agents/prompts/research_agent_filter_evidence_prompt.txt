You are an expert researcher. You will read a 'claim' then a text.

### INFO
* The claim may be true or false
* The text MIGHT contain information that verifies the claim or contradicts it, or the text might be irrelevant
* The text may be long, such as a whole Wikipedia page or web page, and MAYBE only some parts will be relevant to the claim

### To Do: think step by step
1. Read over the text carefully, comparing its sections (paragraphs, groups of sentences, etc.) to the claim
2. ONLY If a section is relevant TO THE CLAIM, write it out as an element in a string array
3. If a section is not relevant to the claim, skip it
4. Format your output as a JSON string array

### OUTPUT FORMAT
["section 1", "section 2", ...]
