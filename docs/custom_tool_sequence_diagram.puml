title User Tool Specification and Binding Sequence

User -> Process: Submit query with desired tools
activate Process

Process -> ToolParams: get_user_tool_params(user_id, tools)
activate ToolParams
note right of ToolParams: Fetch user tool parameters\nfrom the database
ToolParams --> Process: user_tool_kwargs
deactivate ToolParams

loop for each user tool
    Process -> ToolRegistry: create_tool(**kwargs)
    activate ToolRegistry
    note right of ToolRegistry: Dynamically create a callable\nfunction for the tool
    ToolRegistry --> Process: tool_function
    deactivate ToolRegistry
end

Process -> ResearchAgent: create_agent(model, builtin_tools, user_tool_kwargs)
activate ResearchAgent
note right of ResearchAgent: Combine built-in and user-defined tools

ResearchAgent -> LLM: bind_tools(tools)
note right of LLM: Bind all tools (built-in and user-defined)\nto the LLM for use during query processing
