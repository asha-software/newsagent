Given the label '{predicted_label}' and the justification '{justification}', your task is to assess whether the justification logically and coherently supports the given label.

Instructions:
- Respond with a JSON object structured as follows:
{{
    "coherent": true or false,
    "reason": "A short explanation justifying your evaluation"
}}
- "coherent" should be true if the justification clearly and logically supports the label.
- "coherent" should be false if the justification does not logically support or contradicts the label.
- Provide a concise but clear explanation in the "reason" field.
