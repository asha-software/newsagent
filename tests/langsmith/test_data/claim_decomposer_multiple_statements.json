The rumour states the Swedish Academy held a closed-door vote under pressure from tech lobbyists. Official Nobel press releases list no 2025 laureate yet because the decision is traditionally announced in October. Members of the Academy denied any preliminary vote when contacted by journalists. Literary scholars argue the prize rules currently require a human author. Legal analysts point out that copyright law has not settled AI authorship issues. The rumour references an anonymous Twitter account with no verifiable credentials. Newspapers in Sweden reported zero evidence supporting the story. Previous leaks about Nobel winners have proven unreliable. The Academy maintains that deliberations remain confidential until announcement day."
