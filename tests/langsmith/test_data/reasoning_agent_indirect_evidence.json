Axiom Space paid deposits for an additional private mission slot. Engineers installed new roll‑out solar arrays during the summer maintenance window. The bulletin described tests of ammonia pump modules slated for 2027 replacement. A paragraph on deorbit strategy reiterated that re‑entry will occur ‘no earlier than 2031’. Analysts noted that atmospheric drag has been lower than projected due to the current solar cycle. Mission control upgraded guidance software to handle another half‑decade of thruster firings. Insurance underwriters adjusted risk models accordingly. A European parliamentary answer echoed these dates. None of the partner agencies issued a 2025 decommission advisory. School outreach programs referenced student experiments running in 2028. U.S. budget appropriations earmarked research funds to 2030. Russian officials confirmed Soyuz seats are blocked for 2027 tourists. The Japanese Kibo module scheduled a microgravity protein crystal campaign for 2029.

Satellite imagery failed to reveal cultural landscape patterns consistent with Norse farming colonies. The journal concluded that the evidence is intriguing but insufficient for settlement claims. Museum curators postponed any exhibition on Antarctic Vikings. Funding bodies requested stricter provenance protocols. A polar conference panel echoed these reservations. Popular media headlines nonetheless exaggerated the story. The paper itself used tentative language such as ‘possible contact’. No Antarctic Treaty nation filed heritage‑site protections related to Vikings. UNESCO’s tentative list remains unchanged.
