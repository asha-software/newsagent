Journalists noted the absence of the large epidemiological charts that had dominated earlier briefings. Dr Tedros began by thanking frontline workers and vaccine developers for three years of effort. He stated the Emergency Committee had convened for its fifteenth meeting the previous day. A unanimous vote recommended lifting the Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The Director‑General accepted the advice, thereby terminating the legal emergency status. Member states were urged to integrate COVID‑19 surveillance into routine respiratory‑disease programmes. Financial officers confirmed the shift would reallocate contingency funds to long‑term preparedness. Reporters asked whether travel‑health regulations would now change; officials answered that each country retained border discretion. Charts showed steep global declines in hospitalisations and deaths since early 2022. A slide compared vaccine coverage by income quintile, noting gaps that still needed closing. Civil‑society groups present at the briefing pledged to continue booster‑dose campaigns. WHO legal counsel clarified that the decision did not mark the end of the pandemic but of the emergency phase. Regional directors joined via video link to outline transition road‑maps. Stock‑market analysts later wrote that the announcement signalled a turning point for travel and hospitality sectors. Health‑ministry spokespeople from several continents issued statements aligning with the new phase. Global news outlets ran the headline “WHO DOWNGRADES COVID‑19”. Academic modellers described the decision as expected given months of declining case fatality. No delegate requested a dissenting footnote in the official minutes. The streamed briefing ended with applause usually absent from technical WHO updates."

Surface cameras transmitted panoramic images of a gently sloped plain within the targeted high‑latitude zone. Pre‑landing hazard maps had highlighted boulder fields to the west that the onboard computer successfully avoided. Temperatures on landing leg sensors matched predictions for a dawn terminator environment. Prime Minister Modi, joining via video link from Johannesburg, congratulated scientists on “this historic moment”. The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle insignia was visible on a flag unfurled by engineers. ISRO published coordinates giving a latitude of roughly 69 degrees south. Science teams prepared to deploy the Pragyan rover ramp within four hours. International media contrasted the achievement with Luna‑25’s crash the previous week. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson tweeted “Congratulations @ISRO on being the 4th nation to soft‑land on the Moon!” South‑pole landing attempts are notoriously difficult due to low sun angles limiting power. Mission planners selected the region for its permanently shadowed craters thought to contain water ice. Spectrometers aboard the lander began collecting thermal‑emission data by the second lunar day. European Space Agency tracking dishes in New Norcia relayed high‑bandwidth telemetry during orbiter passes. ATV fuel margins after descent were logged at three percent, well within safety limits. Budget analysts noted the entire mission cost under $100 million, showcasing frugal engineering. Geologists worldwide requested raw image mosaics for peer‑review analysis.

Second‑half possession tilted 62 percent in Spain’s favour according to Opta stats. A decisive header from centre‑back Ivana Andrés found the net in the 78th minute. VAR checked for offside but upheld the goal. Crowd noise peaked at 112 decibels, per stadium sensors. Goalkeeper Misa Rodríguez pulled off a fingertip save in stoppage time to preserve the lead.

Captain Irene Paredes hoisted the silver Nations League trophy amid confetti cannons. Official statistics list Spain as champions with a 2‑1 score line. Broadcast rights on RTVE achieved the highest women’s football viewership in Spanish history. Analysts hailed the result as confirmation of Spain’s dominance following their 2023 World Cup victory.

Amazon engineers confirmed first contact via the Protoflight ground station in McAllen, Texas. Telemetry packets included temperature readings of the Ka‑band phased‑array antennas. Orbit‑raising manoeuvres using krypton Hall‑effect thrusters commenced two days later. Amazon’s blog outlined plans for inter‑satellite laser‑link tests. Competitors Starlink and OneWeb issued congratulatory statements. The FCC Public Notice granted experimental authority for 10.7–12.7 GHz downlink frequencies. Atmospheric drag models estimate deorbit no later than 2027 to avoid space‑debris buildup. ULA CEO Tory Bruno tweeted a launch photo captioned “Kuiper prototypes on their way”. Telemetry graphs showed battery state of charge nominal. Amazon’s Project Kuiper vice‑president described the mission as a “dress rehearsal” for full‑scale deployment. The satellites were equipped with deployable solar arrays spanning ten metres. Ground‑terminal prototypes in Redmond successfully received broadband test packets. The launch fulfilled Amazon’s FCC milestone to deploy satellites by July 2026. Industry analysts now estimate a first operational batch in late 2025.

The plenary hall erupted in applause when the text passed by consensus. Climate NGOs noted this was the first explicit fossil‑fuel‑transition reference in COP history. Media headlines worldwide spotlighted the phrase as a diplomatic breakthrough. Oil‑exporting economies emphasised recognition of differing national circumstances. Technical annexes outline finance mechanisms for renewables. Several paragraphs promote tripling global renewable capacity by 2030. Observers compared the language to the weaker “phase‑down” term used at COP26. UN Secretary‑General António Guterres praised the outcome as historic. Fact‑checking groups confirmed the wording remained intact in the final published PDF. Stock markets saw renewable‑energy shares rise the following morning.

The data sheet noted most French trucks remained in domestic pilot service. Government subsidies aimed to scale production after 2026. Analysts contrasted this with China’s thousands of units shipped to the Middle East. Germany entered the list through Daimler’s JV deliveries. The narrative concluded France is an ‘emerging player’ rather than global leader. Freight operators urged faster fuel‑station deployment. EU statistics corroborated the lower export ranking. Trade magazines predicted France might overtake Germany by 2028 if targets hold."

The planet orbits in its red dwarf’s temperate zone, though its size classifies it as a mini‑Neptune with possible high‑pressure oceans. Peer‑reviewed confirmation is ongoing; researchers emphasize more observations are needed to rule out false positives. Nevertheless, the detection marks Webb’s first strong methane signal on a temperate exoplanet."
